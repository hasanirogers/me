excerpt: The year is almost over but I managed to sneak in a surprise before we close out 2023.

My blog post have slowed down quite a bit. I've been busy. I even started an [LLC](https://deificarts.com). But I haven't forgotten about this place. Today I updated the design of the blog to be more inline with my brand. The design is not the only that that's changed. I also migrated from Jekyll to Eleventy and it's been a blast. While I don't have anything technical to cover in this post, I do want to say that I have ideas for some write ups that I plan to get to in early 2024. For now, happy holidays everyone and have a good year!
